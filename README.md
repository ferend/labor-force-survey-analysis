# labor-force-survey-analysis
Labor Force Survey from Istanbul Analysis. Mainly focused on finding gerder-based wage inequality.

## Project Definition

In this project I defined 2 questions related to Labor Force Survey for Istanbul. In first question I estimated an equation for wage, then in second question I determined whether or not a statistically significant gender base difference in the wages.
I started to answer the questions with an analysis on the dataset. Then interpretation part comes for the questions.

Markdown file of the analysis and html output is available.

Some plots and OLS estimations for the equations are available.
